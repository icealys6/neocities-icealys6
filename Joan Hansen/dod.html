        The exciting sequel to <i>100 Years in Miami-Betrayal Under the Palms</i> explores the drama of the next decade starring the Donegon family and their legacy. Featuring the stunning modern-day heiress, Kaitlin, who now heads the family hotel dynasty which was started in the early 1900's by her great-grandfather, Miami pioneer, Aidan Donegon. Suspicions run high as it becomes clear that someone is trying to take the company away from Kaitlin. There are many suspects! Could it be a jealous family member, a lover, a company insider or a  corporation planning a hostile take-over which would rob Kaitlin of her heritage and destroy the family business? Evil runs rampant in Miami in the electrifying climax which will leave the reader breathless! At the present time there are no plans by the author to write a trilogy. However, some readers are asking for just one more book in the Donegon family series, so you never know!

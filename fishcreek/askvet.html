      <dt class="category">Question: Our dog, Sparky, likes to eat whatever the kids are snacking on. Is it OK for the dog
      to eat chocolate?</dt>
      <dd>Answer: Chocolate is toxic to dogs. Please do not feed your dog chocolate. Try playing a game with your children-when you feed them people treats, they can feed Sparky dog treats.</dd>

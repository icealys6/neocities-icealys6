    <h3>How I started writing...</h3>
    <p>
            My interest in writing started way back in my Hillsdale College days in Michigan. I was a reporter for the city newspaper, The Hillsdale Daily News, and co-editor of the college yearbook and a reporter on the college newspaper. In the summers I worked at the Midwestern Writers' Conference at Northwestern University in Evanston where I had the opportunity of listening to famous authors in the workshops as they explained their craft. My mother was a writer of children's books so I grew up in the writing environment. However, as a mother of two children and an educator there never seemed to be enough time to start that first novel which I was longing to write. So instead, I found myself writing grants for educational projects while the ideas for more creative writing were dancing around in my head. Finally, in retirement I actually sat down to write my first novel. I had always enjoyed reading books that were historical fiction so that was the genre I decided upon for my first endeavor. My mother had always encouraged me to write a book about the fascinating history of Miami. I would like to thank the wonderful women who inspired my writing about Miami, my great grandmother and my grandmother who were early settlers in Miami in the early 1900's, and my mother who taught the first kindergarten class in Miami Beach. She arrived from Minneapolis the night before the giant hurricane of 1926 to teach in Miami. I was amazed at the amount of research I needed to do when I decided to cover 100 years in Miami. My relatives were a huge source of information with their early memories. As the book covered four generations of a family, one of my greatest challenges was to have the ages of the characters fit with the various historical events that were occurring throughout the novel. Family Trees had to be compiled and studied. It took me 10 years to complete the novel as I was not a very disciplined writer. If an interesting trip would come up and I traveled the globe, I would leave my writing project for months at a time. Regardless, I finally completed my first novel and was astonished by how much I missed the characters of the book that had become such a big part of my life. For this reason, I happily obliged my readers by writing a sequel,<i>Miami Revisited-Decade of Deceit</i>. Prior to that, I tried my hand in the romantic genre, <i>Bitter Tears</i>. In addition to writing my fourth book, I am a volunteer at Fairchild Botanical Gardens here in Miami and also at my church and spend joyous moments with my daughter and grandchildren.

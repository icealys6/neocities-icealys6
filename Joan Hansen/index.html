The family saga starts in 1896 when the dashing Donegon brothers take the straggly village by storm and help clear the land for Henry Flagler's railroad and Miami's first major hotel, and sweeps all the way to millennium. As Miami grows, so does the family fortune as the Donegon hotel dynasty spreads across the world, but there is a veil of secrecy that hides many sins through the generations. Katlin, fourth generation Donegon, and modern-day knockout and heiress, seems to have it all - beauty, wealth and power. But when tragedy strikes, she learns the shocking family secret that will change her life and set her on a new path of discovery. Set in sizzling Miami, the trendy city rocking to an art Deco beat and hiding many secrets behind the turquoise and flamingo facades -step behind the glittering surfaces to discover the startling BETRAYAL UNDER THE PALMS.

                Readers who read my first book, <i>100 Years in Miami-Betrayal under the Palms</i> seemed to like the main characters and encouraged me to write a sequel that started where the first book ended. I hope you will enjoy the sequel, <i>Miami Revisited-Decade of Deceit</i>. For further description please click onto the book pictured here or the link above to view the details on this and my third book, <i>Bitter Tears</i>.
